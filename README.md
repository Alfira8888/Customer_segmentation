# Customer_segmentation

### This notbook aims to analyze data from the marketing department that contains information about bank customers.

Marketing is a filar for growth and sustainability of any business. Knowlege about markets and customers is crucial for any strategic decisions, which can create a strong brand and increase sales. Segmentation is one the most important application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify groups of customers allowing them to understand customers behaviour and recognize a target of marceting capain. In this machine learning project, I will make use of K-Means clustering, which is the essential algorithm for clustering of unlabeled dataset. Then I will perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensions recuction. Finally, as a comparisson, I will build Autoencoder based on Arfificial Neural Networks in order to reduce feature dimension and then perform again KMeans clustering and PCA.
